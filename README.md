# Arduino-Uno-Thermometer-and-Low-Pressure-Alert-System
This project measures temperature (Fahrenheit and Celsius) and pressure. If there is a low pressure system, the user is alerted. 

The button to the right, when pressed, will give the temperature in Celcius. When there is a low pressure system, the buzzer will beep. To acknowledge this press the left button. While you are being alerted of a low pressure system a message will be displayed on the LCD screen. The thermometer will do this every two hours but you are, of course, free to modify this.

# Issues
Sometimes the LCD screen will go dark and pressure readings will be off by a few inches of Mercury. If this happens, pressing the red reset button should return the thermometer to normal.
